As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of answered questionnaires, as well as electronic data, for a duration of 10 years or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.
    
By providing of further personal data in pseudoanonymized form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymized
scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymized form in medical journals and scientific publications, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.

The information obtained during the course of this study may also be sent in an anonymized form to cooperation partners within the scope of
the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).

The data collected within the scope of the study can also be used and processed in the future inside of the Max Planck Institute.

I was informed about my rights, that at any time:

I can withdraw this declaration of consent.

I can request information about my stored data and request the correction or blocking of data.

By cancellation of my participation in the study,
I can request that any personal data of mine collected until that point are immediately deleted or anonymized.

I can request that my personal data are handed out to me or to third parties (if technically feasible).

I herewith declare that:

I have been adequately informed about the collection and processing of my personal data and rights.

I consent to the collection and processing of personal data within the scope of the study and its pseudoanonymized disclosure,
so that only the persons conducting the study can establish a link between the data and my person.

Agreement:

I agree to participate in this study.

I consent to the use of my data described in the Data Protection Information Sheet
and confirm having received a copy of the Data Protection Sheet.

I consent to data transfer from the MPI for Biological Cybernetics encrypted database to the project-related collaborators:
inside of the Max Planck Society and affiliated research institutes, or at partnering institutions like the University of Tuebingen.

I agree that I only will get paid when I complete the study and that my bonus will only be paid if I pass 75% or more of the attention checks.`
