            <h1>Welcome to the Casino!</h1>
            <br>
            Today, you find yourself in a casino.<br>
            In a series of games you are interacting with two slot machines.<br>
            The slot machines are represented by green squares:<br><br>
            <span text-align="center">
                <img src="../stimuli/slot_machines.png" height="150px">
            </span>
    
            <br><br>
            Each slot machine tends to pay out a certain amount of average points during one game (20 choices), but there is
            noise on the points on any given play.<br>
            For example, the average points for the slot machine on the right might be 50 points, but on the
            first play we might see 38 points because of the noise in the lottery process.<br>
            On the second play we might get 56 points.<br>
            If we take the right slot machine again on the third trial, we might get 51 points this time.<br>
            ... and so on, such that if we were to play the right slot machine 20 times in a row we might see
            that we can expect on average around 50 points from it.<br><br>
            Both slot machines might have different amounts of noise, but their average outcome will be determined for one game. Between games the noise and average outcome
            of each slot machine might change.<br>
                
            Depending on the game type, your goal is either to get or retain as many points as possible. You will get paid a bonus depending to how well you manage to do this.<br><br>

                Response Instruction
            </button>

        <div class="instruction-div" id="page3" style="display:none">
            <h1>Instructions How To Respond In The Task</h1>
    
            
            <b>Choose between one of the two slot machines</b><br>
            You will get paid by the numbers you draw, make sure you try your best.<br>
            To make your choice use your keyboard. Click on the <b>"&larr;"</b> key to draw from the left slot machine and on the <b>"&rarr;"</b> key to draw from the right slot machine.<br>
            <br>
    
            In each game you make 20 choices.<br><br>
    
            There are two different types of games: <br>
            In one type of games you want to maximize your points. The higher the points you draw the higher will be your bonus payment.
            Your bonus payment will be determined on every choice you make.<br>
            In the other type of games you want to retain as many points as possible and thus minimize your loss. Therefore you will start with a counter of points you could maximally loose and your points will be substracted from this starting counter.
            Your bonus payment will be determined on every choice you make. The more points you lose the more money will be substracted from your bonus payment.<br><br>
      
            You will play both games in different blocks of this study. The order will be drawn randomly. Each game will be introduced again before playing it.<br>
            During all games within the maximization block the average points will be around 50 points per trial. During all games within the minimization block the average points will be around -50 points per trial.<br>
            Note that your bonus payment is always dependent on how good you perform in comparison to the worst possible performance and not to the absolute number of points you draw.<br><br>

            To check your attention, we will also sometimes ask you to identify the blue slot machine. When one of the blue slot machines appears, this is an attention check and you have to specify which slot machine is the blue one. <br>
            The attention trial is not part of the game and you will not get points for it. <br>
            We will ask you to confirm your choice by clicking on the "Confirm Choice" button. If you accidentally clicked the wrong key beforehand, you can correct by pressing the correct key before confirming the choice.<br><br>
