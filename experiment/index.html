            <h1>Information on tasks and purpose of the study</h1>
            Today, you are stepping into the role of a gambler visiting a casino. You will play two different types of games.<br>
            Before playing the games, we will will test your working memory. After playing the games, we will ask you to answer some questions about your personality and emotions.<br>
            
            The purpose of the study is to gain knowledge about how different people choose between uncertain options.<br>
            A decision between uncertain options supposedly happens often in everyday life.<br>
            An example would be to decide for an icecream flavour.<br>
            You either decide for a flavour you have already chosen and like or you try out something new because it might taste even better.<br><br>
    
            On the next page you will start with the working memory test and you will get detailed instructions about the specific task you
            are going to carry out.
            <br>
        
            To be eligible to participate, you <strong> MUST </strong> be a fluent speaker of English, and have a keyboard and a mouse or touchpad with your device.<br>
            
            <b style="color:maroon;">Please do not accept this task if you do not fit these criteria or are using a touch screen device, it will not work!</b><br>

            When the experiment will change to fullscreen mode, please do not exit the fullscreen mode until the end of the experiment.<br>
    
            <h4>How much time will it take and how much can you earn?</h4>
            The study will take <b>approx. 60 minutes</b>.<br>
            In any case, you will be paid a base payment of <b>£6.00</b> pounds for your participation.
            Depending on your performance in the memory test and the casino games you can receive a bonus of up to <b>£5.00</b>.<br>
