# Uncertainty Preferences Change From Exploration to Exploitation

Two-armed bandit task, operation span task and psychiatric questionnaires.<br>

When making decisions in everyday life we constantly face the explore-exploit dilemma: should we try out something new or take something that we already know and like? 
This dilemma has been studied extensively using cognitive tasks such as multi-armed bandits. 
While research in cognitive science suggests that people seek uncertainty during exploration, research in economics mostly finds uncertainty avoidance. 
We suggest that these findings are not mutually exclusive, but that uncertainty preferences change over time as individuals move from exploration to exploitation. 
Recent literature leads us to expect that uncertainty seeking turns into uncertainty aversion during learning for gains. 
In the loss domain, we expect a continued preference for uncertain options, given evidence from the economic literature of increased uncertainty seeking in the loss domain. 
To investigate these hypotheses, we introduce a new experimental design in which we control for differences in variances and means in a two-armed bandit task that includes
both gains and losses. We manipulate peopleâ€™s uncertainty about the arms by inducing irreducible variances and thereby irreducible variance differences between arms. 
We find that people use uncertainty more in exploration than in exploitation, switching on average from uncertainty seeking to uncertainty aversion, 
with high individual variability. Surprisingly, this trend is mainly driven by behaviour in the loss domain. However, in line with our expectations, 
the modelling results support the notion of increased uncertainty seeking for losses relative to gains.
